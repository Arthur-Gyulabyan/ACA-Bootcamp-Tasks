# Object / JSON

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a general format to represent values and objects. It is described as in [RFC 4627](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4627 'RFC 4627') standard. Initially it was made for JavaScript, but many other languages have libraries to handle it as well. So itâ€™s easy to use JSON for data exchange when the client uses JavaScript and the server is written on other languages.
