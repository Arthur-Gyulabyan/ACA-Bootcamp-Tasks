The Tic Tac Toe game was developed with complicity of Vahe Ghazaryan.  

The game is not using any algorithms to win, but randomly puts the active players mark on playing area, which is a simple matrix of n<sub>x</sub>n size. After every move the diagonals and each row and column elements are compared to reveal the winner. If no winner found until the last move, then it's supposed to be a draw!
