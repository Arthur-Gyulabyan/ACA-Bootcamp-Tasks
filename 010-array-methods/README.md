# Array Methods

  
### About directory

In this directory have been represented the solutions of some tasks, related to array methods, and the implementation of logic of some array methods. I've tried to implement the logic of array methods in such a way that they best reflect the behavior of real methods. For example the `map` method skips the empty indexes of array, so we need to loop through it by `for in` loop, which does exactly what we need. We also need to explicitly assign the returned value of callback to exact same index of new array, rather than simply push it to the end of that array, so that we gain empty indexes when the initial array has so.

You can find the implementation of some methods from this directory in the lesson 7 directory, but the versions from this one are the improved versions of the previous ones.
