### About file names

In this directory I used a little bit different namings for JavaScript files. Particularly, for direct tasks from task list, I used "direct-task-[task number].js" naming format.
For tasks from [JAVASCRIPT.INFO](https://javascript.info/) I used the same naming format, as in the previous lesson directory.

### About code

In some files I solved the task in more than one way (e.g. [task 20](https://github.com/Arthur-Gyulabyan/ACA-Bootcamp-Tasks/blob/main/lesson-004/direct-task-20.js)). So you need to uncomment some parts of code to see the resultâ€¤ Basically the different ways of solutions are separated by multiline comments (/\* \*/).
